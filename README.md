# Rail net simulator
Program in C++ showing threading on example of railway net simmulation

Program simulates and displays weighted graph where vertices are cities and edges are railways. 
- Weights describe distance from the citties.
- There are trains that can travel between citties. 
- In each city can be finite number of trains at the same time. 
- On one railway can be only one train at once. 
- Routes for trains are prefefined and passed as parameter/in file
- When railway is popular it gets red
- When railway over time if not used get white color
